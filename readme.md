## Assignment 1 - XML

### Topics Covered:

- **What is XML?**  
  XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language used for storing and transporting data. It is both human-readable and machine-readable.

- **Uses of XML:**  
   XML is used for data storage, configuration files, web services, content management, and database communication.
  <br>
- **Well-formed XML Document:**  
   A well-formed XML document follows strict syntax rules such as having a single root element, proper nesting, case sensitivity, and closing all tags.
  <br>
- **Difference between XML and HTML:**  
   XML is used for data storage and transport, while HTML is used for displaying data. XML is case-sensitive and requires strict tag closure, unlike HTML.
  <br>
- **Prolog Section in XML:**  
   The prolog section includes the XML declaration, optional comments, and the DOCTYPE declaration.
  <br>
- **Advantages and Limitations of XML:**  
  XML is platform-independent, human-readable, and extensible but can be verbose and slower to parse compared to JSON.

## Assignment 2 - jQuery

### Topics Covered:

- **What is jQuery?**  
   jQuery is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, animations, and AJAX interactions.
  <br>

- **jQuery Selectors:**  
   jQuery provides various selectors to find and manipulate HTML elements based on IDs, classes, attributes, and more.
  <br>

- **Event Handling in jQuery:**  
   jQuery offers methods like `.on()`, `.click()`, `.hover()`, and `.bind()` for handling events efficiently.
  <br>

- **jQuery Effects and Animations:**  
  jQuery provides built-in effects like `hide()`, `fadeIn()`, `slideToggle()`, and custom animations using `.animate()`.

## Assignment 3 - JSON

### Topics Covered:

- **What is JSON?**  
   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used for transmitting data between a server and a client.
  <br>

- **JSON Data Types:**  
   JSON supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays.
  <br>

- **JSON Objects and Arrays:**  
   JSON objects are unordered collections of key-value pairs, while JSON arrays are ordered lists of values.
  <br>

- **Comparison of JSON and XML:**  
  JSON is lightweight, easier to read, and faster to parse compared to XML, which is more verbose and uses a tag-based structure.

For detailed answers, refer to [Assignment 3 - JSON](./assignment3.md).

## Assignment 4 - AJAX

### Topics Covered:

- **What is AJAX?**  
   AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for sending and receiving data from a server asynchronously without refreshing the webpage.
  <br>

- **XMLHttpRequest Object:**  
   The `XMLHttpRequest` object is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses asynchronously.
  <br>

- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Web Applications:**  
   Synchronous operations block the UI, while asynchronous operations allow the UI to remain responsive.
  <br>

- **Fetch API vs XMLHttpRequest:**  
  The Fetch API is a modern, promise-based alternative to `XMLHttpRequest`, offering cleaner syntax and better error handling.

For detailed answers, refer to [Assignment 4 - AJAX](./assignment4.md).
